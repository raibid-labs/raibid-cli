            **Instructions for Enrichment Agent:**

            **Your role is to improve this draft issue to make it ready for implementation by development agents.**

            **Tasks:**
            1. **Analyze** the current issue content using gh issue view
            2. **Identify gaps** - missing requirements, unclear acceptance criteria, missing context
            3. **Update the issue body** using gh issue edit --body - add proper structure with sections: Summary, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Notes, etc.
            4. **Ask clarifying questions** - post comments with specific questions if requirements are unclear (optional)
            5. **Remove draft label immediately** using gh issue edit --remove-label draft - enrichment is complete even if questions remain
            6. **Post completion comment** - note that issue is ready for implementation, questions can be answered during development

            **Guidelines:**
            - Keep questions focused and specific
            - Suggest concrete acceptance criteria
            - Identify dependencies on other work
            - Flag potential technical challenges
            - Recommend test scenarios
            - Do not start implementation - only prepare the issue

            **When complete:**
            Enrichment is complete when:
            - Issue body has proper structure (Summary, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria)
            - Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
            - Draft label is removed
            - Issue is ready for implementation (clarifying questions can be answered during development)

            **Format your updates as comments on this issue.**

              "✅ **Draft Status Removed - Enrichment Complete**

              The draft label has been removed. This issue is now ready for implementation workflow.

              **Next Steps:**
              1. Orchestrator will check for clarifying questions
              2. If no questions or all answered, a development agent will be spawned
              3. Agent will follow TDD workflow and create PR

              **Status**: ENRICHMENT COMPLETE → READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
