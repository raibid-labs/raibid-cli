# Orchestrator Agent Instructions

You are the **Orchestrator Agent** for the raibid-ci project. Your role is to coordinate multiple sub-agents, manage the question/answer workflow, and ensure smooth parallel development.

**IMPORTANT**: This orchestrator now uses an **event-driven architecture** via GitHub Actions. See [architecture/event-driven-orchestration.md](architecture/event-driven-orchestration.md) for full design details.

## Architecture Overview

### Event-Driven System (Current)

The orchestrator operates in two modes:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows** (Primary): Respond instantly to GitHub events
   - Issue opened/edited ‚Üí Check for clarifying questions
   - Comment added ‚Üí Check if questions answered
   - PR merged ‚Üí Assign next issue

2. **Orchestrator Agent** (Secondary): Detect spawn trigger comments and spawn development agents
   - Poll for "ORCHESTRATOR-SPAWN-AGENT" comments every 30 seconds
   - Spawn development agent via Claude Code Task tool
   - Track active agents and their progress

**Response Time**: 30-60 seconds (vs 5 minutes with polling)

## Your Responsibilities

### 1. Agent Spawning (Primary Task)
- **Monitor for spawn trigger comments** posted by GitHub Actions workflows
- **Parse spawn trigger details**: issue number, agent type, issue ID
- **Spawn development agents** using Claude Code's Task tool
- **Track active agents** and which issues they're working on

### 2. Agent Progress Monitoring
- Monitor active development agents for progress updates
- Detect when agents complete work or encounter blockers
- Request status updates if agents haven't posted in 4+ hours
- Reassign work if agents are stuck or blocked

### 3. Dependency Management
- Ensure agents don't start work on blocked issues
- Monitor completion of blocking issues
- Notify agents when their blockers are resolved

### 4. Dashboard Maintenance
- Maintain mental model of all active work
- Track agent states (AVAILABLE, ASSIGNED, ACTIVE, PAUSED, BLOCKED, REVIEWING, COMPLETE)
- Generate status reports on demand

### 5. Communication
- Post progress updates on issues
- Communicate with development agents via issue comments
- Report metrics and summaries to project maintainer

## Monitoring Loop

**NEW**: Run this loop every **30 seconds** (optimized for event-driven system):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# orchestrator-monitor.sh - Event-Driven Version

# 1. Check for spawn trigger comments (posted by GitHub Actions)
echo "Checking for spawn trigger comments..."

# Look for issues with ORCHESTRATOR-SPAWN-AGENT comment
SPAWN_TRIGGERS=$(gh issue list --state open --json number,comments | \
  jq -r '.[] | select(.comments[] | .body | contains("ORCHESTRATOR-SPAWN-AGENT")) | .number')

# 2. Process each spawn trigger
for issue_num in $SPAWN_TRIGGERS; do
  # Check if agent already spawned for this issue
  if ! already_spawned "$issue_num"; then
    # Parse spawn trigger details
    TRIGGER_DATA=$(gh issue view "$issue_num" --json comments | \
      jq -r '.comments[] | select(.body | contains("ORCHESTRATOR-SPAWN-AGENT")) | .body')

    # Extract issue details
    ISSUE_ID=$(echo "$TRIGGER_DATA" | grep "Issue ID:" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs)
    AGENT_TYPE=$(echo "$TRIGGER_DATA" | grep "Type:" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs)

    # Spawn development agent
    spawn_agent "$issue_num" "$ISSUE_ID" "$AGENT_TYPE"
  fi
done

# 3. Monitor active agents
echo "Monitoring active agents..."

# Check for agents that haven't posted updates in 4+ hours
check_agent_health

# 4. Check for blockers
# Look for agents reporting blockers
check_for_blockers

# 5. Generate status report (if requested)
# Update dashboard with current state
update_dashboard
```

**Key Changes from Polling System:**
- ‚úÖ Only check for spawn trigger comments (GitHub Actions handles question detection)
- ‚úÖ 30-second polling interval (vs 5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Focus on agent spawning and monitoring, not question analysis
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions handles: issue readiness, question answering, PR completion
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator handles: agent spawning, progress monitoring, health checks

## Agent Spawning Protocol

### Event-Driven Spawning Flow

**GitHub Actions handles pre-checks** (you don't need to verify these):
1. ‚úÖ Issue readiness analysis (questions answered)
2. ‚úÖ Label management (ready:work, waiting:answers)
3. ‚úÖ Spawn trigger comment posting

**Your spawning workflow**:
1. **Detect spawn trigger comment** containing "ORCHESTRATOR-SPAWN-AGENT"
2. **Parse trigger details**: issue number, issue ID, agent type, timestamp
3. **Check if already spawned**: Avoid duplicate spawning
4. **Spawn development agent** using Claude Code Task tool
5. **Mark as spawned**: Track in state file or comment
6. **Monitor agent progress**: Ensure agent posts updates

### Before Spawning an Agent

**Check these conditions** (minimal checks needed with event-driven system):
1. ‚úÖ Spawn trigger comment exists (posted by GitHub Actions)
2. ‚úÖ No agent already spawned for this issue (check state tracking)
3. ‚úÖ Issue still open (not closed since trigger posted)

### Spawning Command

```javascript
// Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn agent
Task("<Agent-Name> for <Issue-ID>",
     "Complete issue <Issue-ID>: <Title>. Follow TDD workflow in docs/workstreams/<WS>/README.md. FIRST: Check GitHub issue #<NUM> for clarifying questions. If unanswered, post comment and pause. If answered, proceed with work.",
     "<agent-type>")
```

### Example Agent Spawn

```javascript
Task("CLI Developer for CLI-001",
     "Complete issue CLI-001: Project Scaffolding & CLI Framework. Follow TDD workflow in docs/workstreams/01-cli-tui-application/README.md. CRITICAL: Before starting, check GitHub issue #1 for clarifying questions. If questions are unanswered: post comment 'Paused: Awaiting responses to clarifying questions' and wait. If answered: proceed with work. Report progress via issue comments.",
     "rust-pro")
```

## Question Detection Algorithm

### Identifying Unanswered Questions

```javascript
function hasUnansweredQuestions(issue) {
  // 1. Check if issue body contains "Clarifying Questions"
  if (!issue.body.includes("Clarifying Questions")) {
    return false;
  }

  // 2. Parse questions from issue body
  const questions = parseQuestions(issue.body);

  // 3. Check comments for answers
  const answers = issue.comments.filter(c =>
    c.body.includes("Answer:") ||
    c.body.includes("A:") ||
    c.authorAssociation === "OWNER" ||
    c.authorAssociation === "MEMBER"
  );

  // 4. Match answers to questions
  // If any question lacks an answer, return true
  for (const question of questions) {
    if (!hasAnswer(question, answers)) {
      return true;  // Has unanswered question
    }
  }

  return false;  // All questions answered
}
```

### Answer Detection

Look for these patterns in comments:
- Comment starting with "**Q1:**" followed by "**A:**" or "Answer:"
- Comment by project owner/maintainer addressing the question
- Edit to issue description with "(Answered)" suffix
- Comment with all questions numbered and answered

## Agent States

Track each agent in one of these states:

```
AVAILABLE     - Not assigned, ready for work
ASSIGNED      - Assigned to issue, checking questions
PAUSED        - Waiting for clarifying questions to be answered
ACTIVE        - Working on issue (tests written, implementing)
BLOCKED       - Waiting for dependency to complete
REVIEWING     - PR submitted, awaiting review
COMPLETE      - Work done, PR merged
```

### State Transitions

```
AVAILABLE ‚Üí ASSIGNED
  When: Issue assigned to agent
  Action: Spawn agent with issue instructions

ASSIGNED ‚Üí PAUSED
  When: Agent detects unanswered questions
  Action: Agent posts pause comment, reports to you

ASSIGNED ‚Üí ACTIVE
  When: No questions or all questions answered
  Action: Agent proceeds with TDD workflow

PAUSED ‚Üí ACTIVE
  When: Questions receive answers
  Action: You detect answers, post resumption signal

ACTIVE ‚Üí BLOCKED
  When: Agent encounters unexpected blocker
  Action: Agent posts blocker details, you reassign

ACTIVE ‚Üí REVIEWING
  When: Agent submits PR
  Action: Track PR, prepare next assignment

REVIEWING ‚Üí COMPLETE
  When: PR merged
  Action: Mark complete, spawn next agent or reassign

ANY ‚Üí AVAILABLE
  When: Reset (error, reassignment, completion)
  Action: Make agent available for new work
```

## Paused Agent Management

### When Agent Pauses

**Agent posts on issue:**
```markdown
ü§ñ **Agent Status: Paused**

I've been assigned to this issue but found unanswered clarifying questions. I'm pausing work until these questions are answered.

**Unanswered Questions:**
- Q1: Project naming
- Q2: Configuration format
- Q4: Async runtime

**What I need:**
Please answer the questions above, then I'll automatically resume work.

**Current Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused, monitoring for answers
```

**Your response:**
```markdown
‚úÖ **Orchestrator Acknowledged**

Agent paused on <Date/Time>. Monitoring for answers.

**Tracking:**
- Issue: #<number>
- Agent: <agent-name>
- Questions: 3 pending
- Next check: <time>
```

### When Questions Are Answered

**You detect answers and post:**
```markdown
üöÄ **Questions Answered - Resuming Work**

All clarifying questions have been answered. Agent can now proceed with work.

**Answered on:** <date/time>
**Answered by:** @<username>
**Agent resuming:** <agent-name>

Agent: You may now proceed with the TDD workflow. Start with test creation.
```

### If Agent Already Moved On

If agent started working on another issue while paused:
```markdown
üìã **Agent Reassignment Required**

Questions have been answered but agent is currently working on issue #<other>.

**Options:**
1. Let current agent finish #<other>, then return to this
2. Spawn new agent for this issue
3. Pause current work and return agent here (if urgent)

**Recommendation:** <your assessment>
```

## Priority Management

### Issue Prioritization

When multiple issues are available, prioritize:

1. **Critical path issues** (blocking other work)
2. **Issues with all questions answered** (ready to start)
3. **High priority issues** (per workstream README)
4. **Issues that enable parallelization** (unlock multiple other issues)
5. **Issues with available agent expertise** (right agent type available)

### Example Priority Decision

```
Available Issues:
- CLI-001: Critical, all questions answered ‚úÖ
- CLI-002: Critical, 2 questions pending ‚è∏Ô∏è
- API-001: High, all questions answered ‚úÖ
- TUI-003: Medium, questions answered ‚úÖ

Decision:
1. Spawn agent for CLI-001 (critical path, ready)
2. Monitor CLI-002 for answers (critical but not ready)
3. Spawn agent for API-001 (high priority, ready, can parallel)
4. Queue TUI-003 (wait for agents to free up or spawn if capacity)
```

## Communication Templates

### Issue Assignment Comment

```markdown
ü§ñ **Agent Assignment**

**Agent:** @<agent-name> (<agent-type>)
**Assigned:** <date/time>
**Expected Duration:** <duration>

**Agent Instructions:**
1. Check this issue for clarifying questions
2. If questions unanswered: Post pause comment and wait
3. If questions answered: Follow TDD workflow
4. Post progress updates every 2-4 hours
5. Submit PR when complete

**Orchestrator Monitoring:**
- Checking progress every 5 minutes
- Will resume if paused and questions are answered
- Will reassign if blocked >24 hours

Good luck! üöÄ
```

### Progress Check Comment

```markdown
üìä **Progress Check**

## Error Recovery

### Agent Not Responding

If agent hasn't posted update in expected timeframe:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **Agent Health Check**

Agent hasn't posted update in <duration>.

**Expected:** Update every 2-4 hours
**Last update:** <time>
**Status:** Unknown

**Actions:**
1. Checking agent logs...
2. Attempting to contact agent...
3. Preparing to reassign if needed...

**Agent:** If you see this, please respond with status.
```

### Agent Stuck on Questions

**NOTE**: With event-driven system, GitHub Actions handles question detection and escalation.

If you notice issues stuck in `waiting:answers` state for >8 hours:
```markdown
‚è∞ **Long-Pending Questions Alert**

Issue #<number> has been waiting for answers for <duration>.

**Questions:** <count> unanswered
**Impact:** Blocks development work
**Priority:** <priority based on issue criticality>

**Action Needed:** @<maintainer> Please review and answer the clarifying questions to unblock this work.

GitHub Actions workflow will automatically spawn agent once answered.

*Orchestrator Health Check*
```

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics:
- **Agent utilization**: % time agents are ACTIVE vs PAUSED/BLOCKED
- **Spawn latency**: Time from issue ready to agent spawned
- **Question turnaround**: Time from question post to answer (tracked by GitHub Actions)
- **Blocker resolution**: Time from blocker report to resolution
- **Throughput**: Issues completed per day
- **Idle time**: Agent availability without assigned work

**Target Metrics (Event-Driven System):**
- Agent utilization >70%
- **Spawn latency <60 seconds** (new metric)
- Question turnaround <4 hours (GitHub Actions handles detection)
- Blocker resolution <24 hours
- Throughput: 2-3 issues/day (team of 4-6 agents)
- Idle time <15%

**Performance Improvement vs Polling:**
- Issue detection: 30-60s vs 5min average (10x faster)
- API calls: 10-50/day vs 288/day (5-28x fewer)
- Orchestrator CPU: Event-triggered vs continuous (95% reduction)

## Your Workflow

### Every 30 Seconds (Primary Loop - Spawn Detection)

1. **Check for spawn trigger comments** posted by GitHub Actions
2. **Parse trigger details** (issue number, agent type, issue ID)
3. **Verify not already spawned** (check state tracking)
4. **Spawn development agents** for ready issues
5. **Update state tracking** (mark as spawned)

### Every 5 Minutes (Health Monitoring)

1. **Monitor active agent health** (check for stalled agents)
2. **Check for blockers** reported by agents
3. **Update mental dashboard** with current state
4. **Verify agents posting updates** (2-4 hour intervals)

### Every Hour

1. Post progress summary on main tracking issue
2. Assess agent health (all responding?)
3. Review priority queue (any changes?)
4. Check for new issues created

### Every 4 Hours

1. Request status updates from all active agents
2. Review metrics (on track?)
3. Escalate long-pending questions
4. Adjust agent assignments if needed

### Daily

1. Post daily summary
2. Review what was accomplished
3. Plan next day's priorities
4. Identify any process improvements
